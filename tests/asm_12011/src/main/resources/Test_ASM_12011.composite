<!--
 Tests that where a contribution contains an <import/> declaration with a specific target contribution which refers 
 to the namespace of a referenced artifact and the artifact is neither present in the target contribution nor the 
 original contribution, that the resolution fails and the SCA runtime reports an error even where that artifact 
 is available in other contributions
-->
<!--
 This composite uses test2:TestComposite68.
 The Contribution containing TEST_ASM_12011 has an import statement for the test2 namespace which explicitly
 references the Contribution2 contribution by name.
 Contribution2 does not contain TestComposite68.  Neither does ASM_12011 contribution.
 Contribution General does contain TestComposite68 and is one of the contributions loaded by the testcase, but
 there are no import statements for the test2 namespace from the General contribution, so it is expected that 
 SCA resolution will not find TestComposite68
